## ‚ö†Ô∏è Project Status: Archive Mode

**News generation has been discontinued as of September 18, 2025.**

This project now serves as a showcase demonstrating how interesting multi-model AI results can be achieved with minimal operational costs. The existing news archive remains available for exploration.

## üöÄ What was llm-news?

**llm-news** was an automated news aggregation system that fetched trending topics and generated daily summaries using multiple state-of-the-art LLMs (Gemini, GPT-4, Claude).
The news was updated daily via GitHub Actions and served directly through GitHub Pages ‚Äî no servers or backend required!

- **Automated**: News generation runs on GitHub Actions.
- **Multi-Model**: Easily configurable to use different LLMs.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Worked

The system employed a sophisticated multi-model approach:

1. **Multi-Provider Strategy**:
   - **Gemini models**: Used grounded Google Search for real-time data
   - **OpenAI models**: Leveraged web_search_preview tool with structured output
   - **Claude models**: Direct API calls with contextual understanding

2. **Two-Step Process**:
   - Topic discovery with web search capabilities
   - JSON conversion using provider-specific models

3. **Automated Publishing**:
   - News JSON was committed to the repository
   - Instantly available via GitHub Pages
   - Zero infrastructure costs

## üåü Key Achievements

- **Near-Zero Costs**: Entire system ran on free GitHub Actions minutes and minimal API calls
- **Multi-Model Comparison**: Side-by-side outputs from 8+ different LLMs for the same news
- **Fully Automated**: Scheduled workflows with automatic conflict resolution
- **Static Architecture**: No servers, databases, or maintenance required
- **Model Diversity**: Gemini, GPT-4, Claude models all working in parallel

## üìä Models Used

The archive contains news generated by:
- Gemini: 2.5-pro, 2.5-flash, 2.0-flash, 2.5-flash-lite
- OpenAI: GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini
- Anthropic: Claude-3.5-sonnet, Claude-3.5-haiku

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Re-enabling News Generation (For Forks)

If you fork this project and want to re-enable automated news generation:

1. **Uncomment the schedule triggers** in the workflow files:
   - `.github/workflows/anthropic-news-aggregator.yml`
   - `.github/workflows/gcloud-news-aggregator.yml`
   - `.github/workflows/openai-news-aggregator.yml`

2. **Add your API keys** as GitHub repository secrets:
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY`
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

3. **For local testing**, create a `.secrets` file:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
   ```

4. **Run workflows locally with act**:
   ```
   act -W .github/workflows/gcloud-news-aggregator.yml
   ```
