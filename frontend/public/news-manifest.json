These demonstrations build on a series of prior protests since Trump's re-election, including the June 14 'No Kings' protests opposing perceived authoritarianism, and nationwide immigration protests sparked by increased ICE raids and the controversial deployment of federal military forces in states like California. Women's March has organized over 140 events for 'Free America Weekend,' calling attention to critical issues such as poverty, discrimination, and fear-based politics. Additional demonstrations, dubbed 'No Kings 2.0,' will focus on immigration justice and solidarity, emphasizing non-violent action in several states. Protests are also expected outside Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence, featuring symbolic acts like flying a baby Trump balloon. Moreover, The People's Union USA urges a nationwide boycott of corporate July 4 events, encouraging local support and community action to protest wealth inequality and social injustices. These events represent a significant continuation of public dissent against Trumpâs policies and perceived erosion of democratic freedoms.",
