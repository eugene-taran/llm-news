          "description": "A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled against President Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants. The court found that the situation did not constitute an 'invasion or predatory incursion' as required by the 18th-century law. This decision is the latest in a series of legal challenges to the Trump administration's immigration policies.",

Aspergillus flavus, found in tombs like that of King Tut, was once feared for its deadly spores. Now, scientists at Penn and several partner institutions have extracted a new class of molecules from itâcalled asperigimycinsâthat show powerful effects against leukemia cells. These compounds, part of a rare group known as fungal RiPPs, were bioengineered for potency and appear to disrupt cancer cell division with high specificity.",

Despite Trump's aggressive push for domestic fossil fuel expansionâincluding an official declaration of a \"national energy emergency\" to fast-track drillingâthe U.S. rig count has now fallen to its lowest level in nearly four years, according to a report by Baker Hughes, the energy technology company. It showed that the rig count was 539 on July 3, down by 47 compared to this time last year. While the gap between Trump's promises and the drilling reality threatens to become a flashpoint in the energy debate, executives and analysts say that market forces lie at the heart of the rig decline: flagging oil prices, investor pressure for financial returns, and technological shifts that allow producers to extract more oil with fewer rigs.",

          "description": "Wall Street reached new record highs as strong U.S. economic data, including solid retail sales and a robust Philly Fed business index, boosted investor confidence. The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model forecasts 2.4% Q2 growth, outperforming consensus expectations. Corporate earnings from United Airlines and PepsiCo also beat forecasts, reinforcing market optimism. Despite tensions from President Trump's repeated attacks on Fed Chair Jerome Powell, investors remained unfazed. Speculation about Powell's potential removal sparked minimal market reaction, reflecting investor skepticism or belief such changes are already priced in.",

The case involved the merger between two Samsung affiliates, Samsung C&T and Cheil Industries, which prosecutors had alleged was designed to consolidate Leeâs control of the tech giant. A lower court had also cleared him of the charges last year. Business lobby groups have welcomed the courtâs decision, calling it a 'stabilising development for the South Korean economy'.",

However, the two others were not as badly damaged and may have been degraded only to a point where nuclear enrichment could resume in the next several months if Iran wants it to, according to a recent U.S. assessment of the destruction caused by the military operation. The assessment was briefed to some U.S. lawmakers, Defense Department officials, and allied countries in recent days.",

These demonstrations build on a series of prior protests since Trump's re-election, including the June 14 'No Kings' protests opposing perceived authoritarianism, and nationwide immigration protests sparked by increased ICE raids and the controversial deployment of federal military forces in states like California. Women's March has organized over 140 events for 'Free America Weekend,' calling attention to critical issues such as poverty, discrimination, and fear-based politics. Additional demonstrations, dubbed 'No Kings 2.0,' will focus on immigration justice and solidarity, emphasizing non-violent action in several states. Protests are also expected outside Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence, featuring symbolic acts like flying a baby Trump balloon. Moreover, The People's Union USA urges a nationwide boycott of corporate July 4 events, encouraging local support and community action to protest wealth inequality and social injustices. These events represent a significant continuation of public dissent against Trumpâs policies and perceived erosion of democratic freedoms.",
