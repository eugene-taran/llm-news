Despite Trump's aggressive push for domestic fossil fuel expansion—including an official declaration of a \"national energy emergency\" to fast-track drilling—the U.S. rig count has now fallen to its lowest level in nearly four years, according to a report by Baker Hughes, the energy technology company. It showed that the rig count was 539 on July 3, down by 47 compared to this time last year. While the gap between Trump's promises and the drilling reality threatens to become a flashpoint in the energy debate, executives and analysts say that market forces lie at the heart of the rig decline: flagging oil prices, investor pressure for financial returns, and technological shifts that allow producers to extract more oil with fewer rigs.",

These demonstrations build on a series of prior protests since Trump's re-election, including the June 14 'No Kings' protests opposing perceived authoritarianism, and nationwide immigration protests sparked by increased ICE raids and the controversial deployment of federal military forces in states like California. Women's March has organized over 140 events for 'Free America Weekend,' calling attention to critical issues such as poverty, discrimination, and fear-based politics. Additional demonstrations, dubbed 'No Kings 2.0,' will focus on immigration justice and solidarity, emphasizing non-violent action in several states. Protests are also expected outside Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence, featuring symbolic acts like flying a baby Trump balloon. Moreover, The People's Union USA urges a nationwide boycott of corporate July 4 events, encouraging local support and community action to protest wealth inequality and social injustices. These events represent a significant continuation of public dissent against Trump’s policies and perceived erosion of democratic freedoms.",
