      "title": "Russia Attacks Ukraine as New Audio Reveals Candidate Trump Told Putin He’d Bomb Moscow",
      "description": "Russia launched a barrage of hundreds of drones and missiles at Ukraine’s capital overnight, killing at least two people and wounding 16 others. The attack sparked fires across Kyiv with damage to residences, vehicles, and warehouses. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the bombardment “a clear escalation of terror” by Moscow. Meanwhile, CNN has revealed that Donald Trump told a private gathering of wealthy donors last year that he once sought to deter Russian President Vladimir Putin from attacking Ukraine by threatening to “bomb the [blank] out of Moscow” — though Trump used an expletive. The revelation came in audiotapes recorded at fundraisers in New York and Florida.",

While the gap between Trump's promises and the drilling reality threatens to become a flashpoint in the energy debate, executives and analysts say that market forces lie at the heart of the rig decline: flagging oil prices, investor pressure for financial returns, and technological shifts that allow producers to extract more oil with fewer rigs.",
