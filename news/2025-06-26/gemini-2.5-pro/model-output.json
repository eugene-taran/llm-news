An initial assessment from the Defense Intelligence Agency suggested that Tehran's nuclear program might only be set back by a few months. However, the heads of the CIA and the Director of National Intelligence have since stated that new intelligence indicates the damage is \"severely damaged\" and could take \"years\" to rebuild. The White House has firmly supported the view of a significant setback for Iran's nuclear ambitions, with President Trump stating the facilities were \"obliterated\". In a press conference, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended the success of the strikes, dubbed \"Operation Midnight Hammer,\" and criticized media coverage of the initial, less optimistic intelligence assessments.", "source": "CBS News", "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/iran-nuclear-sites-us-strikes-new-intelligence/"}, {"title": "Starmer in crisis talks over changes to welfare bill as he attempts to stave off MPs' rebellion.", "description": "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing a significant rebellion from within his own Labour Party over proposed cuts to disability and sickness benefits. More than 120 Labour MPs have signed an amendment that could halt the legislation, expressing concerns that the changes have not been properly scrutinized and could push a quarter of a million more people into poverty. In response to the growing mutiny, the government has entered into \"conversations\" with the rebels, signaling potential changes to the welfare reform bill. This marks a shift in tone from the government's initial firm stance and comes as some former Labour figures warn of a \"humiliating\" no-confidence vote if the rebellion is not addressed.", "source": "The Independent", "link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/keir-starmer-labour-welfare-cuts-bill-b2569631.html"}, {"title": "3 dead and a dozen missing as torrential rains cause flash flood in north India.", "description": "At least three people have died and around a dozen are missing after torrential rains triggered a flash flood in the northern Indian state of Himachal Pradesh.

The region has been experiencing a severe heatwave, which is now being followed by heavy rainfall, leading to dangerous conditions. Authorities have evacuated dozens of stranded tourists and have issued warnings for more rain, which could lead to further flash floods, landslides, and a rise in river levels.
